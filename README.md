| Folder | Description  |
|:--|:--|
| `data`| blah|   
| `data/cpi_gilts`|  Raw data from USS. These are the cpi prdictions from valuations held in 2020, 2018, November 2017, September 2017, 2014 and 2011. 2020 also has gilts projections. All projections are 1-year forward rates. These are used to convert discount-rates and cashflows from the nominal-basis to the cpi-basis.  |
| `data/discount_rates` | Raw data from USS. Given in a mix of cpi-basis, nominal-basis and gilts-basis. These are the prudent-assumptions used at each valuation to discount cpi-basis cashflows back to the valuation date to calculate the Liabiliites on a Technical Provisions basis, it is equivalent to calculating the Net Present Value of the future cost of pension provision.|  
| `data/assets_returns` | Raw data from USS. These are the annual reported investment returns on the Income Builder (DB) part of the USS fund. Given as annual percentage. Also the reported value of assets (GBP) in the Income Builder (DB) part of the fund.|
