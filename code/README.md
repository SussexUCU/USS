## USS pensions code

- `uss_pensions.py` - a python module for reading in data and defining useful functions for operating on it.
- `plot_assets.ipynb` - a Jupyter Notebook which shows how the module is used to calculate CPI-adjusted USS asset values and plot them in a clone of [Sam Marsh's famous graph from USSBriefs 106](https://medium.com/ussbriefs/how-extreme-prudence-and-misguided-risk-management-sent-the-uss-into-crisis-baf78c35d9e1).
