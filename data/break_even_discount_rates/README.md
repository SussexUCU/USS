# Calcs

Here are links to google sheet calculations for 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021 calculations of breakeven discount rates. 

The process is roughly as follows. 

## Method for 2017 and 2020

Use cashflows for 2017 and 2020 (both provided by USS) and the USS provided discount rates to calculate the TP Liabilites and check they agree within 1% of the USS calculated TP Liabilities. Then use the same calculation to find a 2 d.p. discount rate percentage that produces the smallest surplus possible. 

## Method for 2018 and 2021

Use the cashflows for 2017 (both provided by USS) but add the 1-year projected cashflows (USS use these to calculat the Future Service Costs). There is a problem that the first year of cashflows includes regular DB pension paymenst plus lumpsumps and disability/death in service. So some unknown fraction of the first year of payments will have been paid during 2017 and 2020 respectively. To estimate this fraction find the fraction of y1 cashflows that reproduce the USS calcluated TP liabiliites within 1%. This esimate is 0.6. Use this same calculation to find a 2 d.p. discount rate percentage that produces the smallest surplus possible.

JG: I will eventually upload these as Excel docs to this space, but only once a few more people have sense checked the calcs. 

Breakeven discount rates are given to 1 d.p. as a percentage, but probably only accurate to 1 d.p. Breakeven discount rates also checked against Excel IRR function.
