# Calcs

Here are links to google sheet calculations for 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021 calculations of breakeven discount rates. 

The process is roughly as follows. 

## Method for 2017 and 2020

Use cashflows for 2017 and 2020 (both provided by USS) and the USS provided discount rates to calculate the TP Liabilites and check they agree within 1% of the USS calculated TP Liabilities. Then use the same calculation to find a 2 d.p. discount rate percentage that produces the smallest surplus possible. 

## Method for 2018 and 2021

Use the cashflows for 2017 and 2020 (both provided by USS) but add the 1-year projected cashflows which are also given (USS use these to calculate the Future Service Costs). However there is a problem in that the first year of cashflows includes DB pension paymenst plus lumpsumps and disability/death in service. So some unknown fraction of the first year of payments will have been paid during 2017 and 2020 respectively. To estimate this fraction we find the proportion of y1 cashflows that reproduce the USS calcluated TP Liabiliites within 1%. Then use this same calculation to find a discount rate percentage that produces the smallest surplus possible.

Breakeven discount rates calculated in google sheets below and then quoted above in .csv files. 
(JG: I will eventually upload these as Excel files to this folder, but only once the calcs have had final check.)
