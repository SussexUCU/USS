# Calculations of breakeven discount rates

Breakeven annualised returns are the asset returns that mean the scheme is fully (100%) funded. 

Here is the link to the google sheets for estimates of breakeven annualised returns for 2011 and 2014. Results for 2011 and 2014 are then quoted to 1 s.f. in the .csv files linked above. 
(JG: I will eventually upload these as Excel files to this folder, but only once the calcs have had final check.)

The calculation method is roughly as follows.

## Method for calculating 2011 and 2014

Calculate the standard deviation (SD) for valuations 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021 using the USS quoted best estimates (assumed 50% CL) and prudent values (with know prudence % CL). Ignore the 2020 as the standard deviation is anomalous. Note that 2017, 2018 and 2021 standard deviations are very similar. Average the SDs for these three valuations. Use this average value of SD to determine the best estimate (50% CL) from the prudent discount rates for 2011 and 2014. Sense check.
